19
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,500
我从没见过有人把自己的智商写到简历里呢
I've never seen anyone put their IQ on a CV before.

20
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,180
你面过多少家了
How many of these have you had?

21
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,590
九个  四个在纽约
Nine. Four in New York,

22
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,740
四个在这边  一次网面
four here, and a Skype.

23
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,910
那你还来这干什么
Why are you here, then?

24
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,200
我的回答可能比较直接  但...
Well, it's not a very political answer, but...

25
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,510
我认为那些找私人家教的家长
I think mediocrity is too well-hidden

26
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,660
把平庸之才都精心掩盖起来了
by parents who hire private tutors.

27
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,390
而我是靠自己来的
I am here on my own.

28
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,370
我希望把自己的观点讲清楚
I want to be able to explain myself clearly,

29
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,230
并且让大家对我的想法持接受的态度
urn, and have people be receptive to my ideas.

30
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,550
你就是靠这个来获得认可的吗
Is that how you get your validation?

31
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,030
让大家都倾听你的话
People listening to you?

32
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,520
相对于什么呢...
As opposed to, uh...?

33
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,600
每个成功的企业中
Every successful business

34
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,740
都有很多人花钱去
is full of people who've spent money

35
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,720
培养原本平庸的能力
nurturing unremarkable talent.

36
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,230
你为什么要读地理
Why did you read Geography?

37
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,730
前一年申请读地理的人最少
Geography had the least amount of applicants the year before.

38
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,690
这就是个边际收益的边际博弈
You know, it's a marginal game about marginal gains.

39
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,510
走个捷径也没什么错
Nothing wrong with the back door.

40
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,980
相比起耶稣基督和玛格丽特·撒切尔
I played third fiddle to two figures in my mother's life,

41
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,250
对我妈来说我是无足轻重的第三个
Jesus Christ and Margaret Thatcher.

42
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,710
那你对他们二位的看法呢
And where do you stand on them?

43
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,040
一人是我们大家在这的原因  另一人是个木匠
One's the reason we're all here, and the other's a carpenter.

44
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,810
我认为这是最接近以才取人的地方了
I think this is the closest thing to a meritocracy there is.

45
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,550
而我就希望别人
And I only ever want to be judged

46
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,290
能以我的能力来评判我
on the strength of my abilities.

47
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,150
并付你相应的薪水
And paid for it.

48
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,130
应该是吧
I guess.

49
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,510
我没想到我们还从
I didn't realize that we recruited

50
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,450
纽约州立大学宾汉姆顿分校招聘
from SUNY Binghamton.

51
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,980
应该不在目标学校里的
It's a nontarget.

52
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,560
你能给我们讲个笑话吗
Can you tell us a joke?

53
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,640
好
Uh, ye-- yeah.

54
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,090
是有点和工作之类的相关的
it's a bit for work, urn, or whatever.

55
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,800
你知道要把你彻底弄来伦敦
You know how many mountains I'd have to move

56
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,670
我得要搞定多少个障碍吗
to get you to London for good?

You don't look sure how to navigate that.

60
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,970
请今年的毕业生们到二楼礼堂集合

69

70
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,720
商标留在袖子上了  好家伙

让我来帮你吧
Let me just do that for you,

76
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,720
省得你在同伴面前被嘲笑
before you embarrass yourself in front of your peers.

77
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,460
要知道  你这么做无异于树了个大广告牌
You see, what you've done there is actually erect a billboard

Yes, uh, I still don't have your university transcript.

146
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,680
真的很抱歉  我会尽快处理的
I'm really sorry. I will get on it.

147
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,150
上周你就这么说的
You said that last week.

148
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,290
哈珀·斯登  你是国际候选人  是吧
Oh, Harper Stern, you're an international candidate, right?

149
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,440
我这还没有你的成绩单
I'm still missing your transcript.

150
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,130
我还在等我的学校寄过来
I'm still waiting on my college to send a copy.

151
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,490
他们出了名的慢
They are notoriously slow.

152
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,570
我们现在就捅破这层窗户纸吧
We're moving out of that gray area now,

153
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,160
这已经对我们构成了小小的困扰
where it's becoming a bit of a problem for us,

154
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,680
对你来说也是问题
and therefore a problem for you.

155
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,580
抱歉  你可以继续你的事了
Sorry. You may continue your quest.

156
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,640
去厕所吧
For the loo.

157
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,630
谢谢
Thank you.

158
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,290
{\an8}不要觉得奇怪  我有事找你帮忙

159
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,010
哈珀
Harper.

160
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,470
你回过家吗
Have you been home?

161
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,520
你好像没回过家
You're just, like, never in your room,

162
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,390
还穿着和昨天一样的衣服
and you're wearing an... identical outfit to yesterday?

163
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,890
我要记下晚上工作的时间
Well, I'm logging those nocturnal hours.

164
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,690
尽量给公司留下一个好印象
Trying to make a good impression, you know?

165
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,820
不用估算
Don't try to figure out

166
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,970
投资银行部一小时会付你多少钱
how much you get paid by the hour in IBD,

167
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,390
因为我向你保证肯定会比最低工资还要少
because I will guarantee you it is less than minimum wage.

168
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,390
在我看来  我在象牙塔的上端
Well, the way I see it, I'm in the ivory tower upstairs,

169
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,880
而你和农民们一起躺在地板上
you're down here on the floor with the peasants.

170
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,640
有这么一瞬间  我以为你会找我攀谈
Well, for a minute, I thought you were actually gonna talk.

171
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,270
你来这里已经三个星期
You know, you've been here for three weeks,

172
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,430
却几乎没和我说过一句话
and you've barely said a word to me.

173
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,380
抱歉  我只是一直忙着
I'm sorry. I've just been underwater

174
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,070
备份埃里克的账户
backing up Eric's accounts.

175
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,630
我知道我们俩都是埃里克的手下
I know we both work for Eric,

176
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,200
但我是你的部门经理
but I'm your line manager.

177
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,050
他有叫你去见客户吗
Has he asked you to meet clients?

178
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,180
当然没有
No. For sure not, no.

179
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,540
明天我和马隆默瑟公司的人一起吃晚饭
Well, I've got this dinner tomorrow night with Mallon Mercer.

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,070
妮可·克雷格  虽然只是我单方面邀约
Nicole Craig. It's a bit of a one-way relationship,

181
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,750
但是对公司来说很重要
but substantial to the firm.

182
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,750
这是一个提高你作为毕业生知名度的机会
It's a chance to increase your visibility as a grad.

183
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,720
你要一起去吗
Do you want to tag along?

184
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,880
好的
Yeah. Yes.

185
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,270
我会查查她的资历
I'll look into her mandate.

186
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,960
不用想太多
Don't overthink it.

187
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,870
你有这么渴吗
Are you that thirsty?

188
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,050
如果你有三十块的饭补
Well, you know, if you got a 30 quid meal allowance,

189
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,620
为什么不用光呢
like, why would you not use all of it?

190
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,760
太没品位了
That's very naff.

191
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,920
你的模型怎么样了
How's your model?

192
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,000
我会在早上做完的
I'll finish it in the morning.

193
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,360
发给我  我能做
Send it over my way, I've got capacity.

194
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,130
你怎么做得了
How do you have capacity?

195
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,360
-耐抗的金融人对吧  -我不知道那是什么
- Brutal finance guy, innit? - I don't know what that is.

196
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,000
你要走了
You bouncing'?

197
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,680
现在才10点15分
Hey, man. Hey. It's only 10: 15.

198
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,180
这里没人会这么和你说
No one here is actually gonna tell you this,

199
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,930
但是你要坐在办公室里
but you need to put in face time.

200
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,350
其实我不用
Actually, I don't.

201
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,640
熬夜并不能提高我的工作效率
Staying up all night doesn't enhance my work.

202
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,210
伙计  伙计
Mate. Mate!

203
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,700
{\an8}评估报告  管理案例

204
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,930
-给我看看你的房间  -我的房间
- Let me see your room. - My room?

205
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,880
-好  -看吧
- Yeah. - Yeah, check it.

206
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,490
皮尔庞特的临时住所
It's Pierpoint's temp accommodation

207
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,790
-给外地人住的  -好吧
- for out-of-towners. - Okay, okay, okay.

208
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,900
看起来不错
Looks crazy.

209
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,480
让那些常青藤盟校的黑鬼
How easy is it to get them Ivy League niggas

210
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,640
和你一起回家容易吗
to come home with you?

211
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,230
我只是来工作的
I'm just here to work.

212
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,900
只有和你一起的时候才会涉及到性
It's only with you that everything becomes sexual.

213
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,590
所以你打电话给我
So the only reason you're calling me

214
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,580
只是因为你想要一张假成绩单吗
is that you want a fake transcript?

215
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,260
你肯定非常需要
You must need it pretty bad.

216
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,030
你确定你只想要张假成绩单吗
You sure that's all you need?

217
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,180
怎么  我还需要别的东西吗
Why? What else would I want?

218
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,030
你拿什么来交换
What are you offering?

219
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,620
你找到工作了吗  陶德
Did you get a job yet, Todd?

220
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,380
没有  干了些活  还没收到钱
Nah, I did some unpaid shit.

221
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,810
通过兴趣来赚钱太难了
It's hard to make money off your passion.

222
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,960
除非你的兴趣就是赚钱
You know, unless your passion's... money.

223
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,050
去你的
Fuck you.

224
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,140
好吧  但如果我能让你们银行
Okay, but if I can make your bank

225
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,820
相信你是研究生毕业  对你有多大价值
think you're graduated, what's that worth to you?

226
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,720
干嘛  你今晚缺个炮友  是吗
What, you didn't get to fuck tonight? Is that it?

227
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,110
我是说...  *如果你需要大屌*
I mean...*If you need dick*

228
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,380
*就来找我吧*
*I got you*

229
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,450
屁股翘起来  美臀给我看看
Ass up. What that ass do?

230
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,730
你没听老爹的话  他会...
You don't listen to what Daddy says. He's going to--

231
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,090
别管他
Just ignore it.

232
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,820
哥们  早会要开始了
This morning meeting's about to start, mate.

233
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,720
如果老爹的话真对你有影响
If-- if what Daddy said actually affected you,

234
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,580
你就不会还在打电话了
then you wouldn't still be on the phone now.

235
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,310
你为什么修改加权平均资本成本
Why have you changed the WACC?

236
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,720
贴现现金流估值太低了
The DCF was coming out too low.

237
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,500
那和可比交易估值相比呢
Well, how does it compare to the transaction comps?

238
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,900
这些盈利前独角兽企业交易都是疯狂翻倍
These pre-profit unicorns trade on crazy multiples.

239
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,420
八倍  九倍
Eight times, nine times.

240
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,910
加上流动性贴水  我们才刚超过贴现现金流估值
Less a liquidity discount, We'd be just over the DCF.

241
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,100
好的  很棒
All right, fantastic.

242
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,010
这是什么
What's that?

243
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,710
这是我的模型
That's my model.

244
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,460
你为什么在建模  加斯才负责建模
Why are you doing the model? Gus is doing the model.

245
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,950
我有余力  我只是想超前一点
I had capacity. I just wanted to get ahead.

246
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,510
哈里  我叫你做项目分析报告
Hari, I told you to do the pitchbook,

247
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,250
你他妈就去做项目分析报告  好吗
so do the fucking pitchbook, okay?

248
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,050
饥饿救星想要提升配送速度
HungerFix want to optimize delivery speed,

249
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,780
所以他们在寻找有优秀导航技术的中型企业
so they're looking at mid-caps with best-in-class GPS tech.

250
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,840
背景清楚的公司  户户送  优步美食...
Clear comps. Deliveroo, Uber Eats...

251
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,580
我找到一些公司  有很好的卫星导航专利
I've found something with good sat-nav IP.

252
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,090
-他们体量很小  -别他妈找了
- They're quite small-- - Don't fucking fish!

253
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,500
严格按流程办
Stick to the formatting.

254
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,880
还有  记住了  要用12号的瑞士风格字体
And for fuck sake, make sure the font's Helvetica 12

255
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,310
不然董事总经理会发火的
or the MD will freak.

256
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,110
而且我可能得带你们中的一个去会场
And I might have to take one of you into the pitch.

257
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,240
我会主导  但你们出现一下也挺好
I'll lead, but it'll be good for your visibility.

258
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,080
-你什么在做我的模型  -哥们  这是团队工作
- Why are you doing my model? - Mate, it's the team's work.

259
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,830
不  这是我的工作
No, it's my work.

260
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,670
你总觉得要一直比出胜负  那不是我的错
It's not my fault you feel the need to keep score.

261
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,700
我就不这样
I don't.

262
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,360
所以  我猜昨晚是在博伊斯代尔餐厅
So, I'm guessing last night was Boisdale?

263
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,130
博伊斯代尔  赫特福德五号  还有不变的安娜贝尔
Boisdale. Five Hertford, and then, inevitably, Annabel's.

264
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,590
三巨头
The triumvirate.

265
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,490
就像老朋友的拥抱
Like the embrace of an old friend.

266
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,180
对了  好吧  我发表了一篇文章
Right. Okay, urn... So, I've published a piece

267
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,900
回顾金融危机后的这十年
looking back at the decade post-crisis.

268
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,100
三段式  住房  2007至2009年...
Three stages. Housing, 2007 to 2009--

269
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,900
我们怎么才能把后视镜里的东西变成钱呢
How are we supposed to monetize what's in the rear-view mirror?

270
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
好吧...
Well, urn...

271
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,540
有新的买入建议吗
Any new buy recommendations?

272
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,470
还是强烈推荐美国方面
Still overweight with a preference for the US.

273
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,620
即使保证金和估值一直居高不下吗
Even with margins and valuations at all-time highs?

274
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,990
如果没有实质变化  为什么要费心发表呢
Why bother publishing if there are no material changes?

275
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,040
好吧  我想卡斯帕会为我的性格买单的
Well, I suppose Kaspar can pay for my personality.

276
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,150
你不介意的话可以把我的笔记读给他听
Well, you can read my note out loud to him if you'd like.

277
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,680
这又不是广告  对吧
It's not exactly commercial, is it?

278
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,390
研究团队再一次出色地
Once again, the research team excel

279
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,920
浪费了销售团队的时间
in wasting salespeople's time.

280
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,700
又一次退场了
Oh, another walkout.

281
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,910
一份鳕鱼配培根  不要奶酪
So, it's one cob with bacon, no Stilton,

282
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,570
另一份不要...  不不  等等  抱歉
and the other one without-- No, no, no, Wait. Sorry.

283
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:34,110
第一份是要培根的  谢谢  还有...
The first one I need with bacon. Urn, thank you. And, uh-- Oh.

284
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,340
抱歉  我特别说了不要沙拉酱
Sorry, I specifically said, "No dressing."

285
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,160
你又把牛给喂饱了吗

我的第一顿正经晚餐是跟菲利普·贾布里一起吃的
My first proper dinner was with Philippe Jabre.

287
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,220
就是对冲基金的那个人  他很有名
You know, from hedge funds? He's famous.

288
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,620

00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,620
我们十几个人在松久餐厅  08年前的松久
Dozen of us at Nobu, pre-08 Nobu.

290
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,520
我有肠胃炎
I had gastroenteritis.

291
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,500
当场吐了出来
Threw up at the table.

292
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,410
贾布里说那是整晚我嘴里冒出的
Jabre said it was the first interesting thing

293
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,380
第一件有趣的事
to come out of my mouth all night.

294
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,910
那只说对了一半
That's only half true.

295
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,460
但他还是给我打了电话
But he still called.

296
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,910
我依然拿到了他的单子
I still printed his business.

297
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,120
那才最重要
That's the bar.

298
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,910
别听达莉娅说这只是次晚餐
Don't let Daria tell you it's just dinner.

299
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,700
我会好好策划的
I'll work on a pitch.

300
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,170
你又要逼哪个毕业生
Which grad do you have to bully

301
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,060
去替你买三明治
to get a fucking sanger?

302
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,690
费利姆  卡普里怎么样了
Felim, how was Capri?

303
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,200
-你必须离开这里  -为什么
- You need to get out of here. - Why?

304
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,080
过去48小时内你只离开了一次这幢楼
You've only left the building once in the last 48 hours.

305
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,660
你的身份识别卡已被自动标记为红色
It's automatically red flagged by your ID card.

306
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,550
我不想知道你前几天是在哪里睡的
I don't want to know where you've been sleeping,

307
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,390
但我需要你从视觉上离开这间办公室
but optically, I need you to walk out of the office,

308
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,920
刷卡出去  做点什么  然后再回来
tap your card out, do whatever, then come back.

309
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,490
-不许再被标红了  -好的  对不起
- No more red flag. - Okay. Sorry.

310
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,740
你没惹麻烦
You're not in trouble.

311
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,170
我很感激你想公司之所想  急公司之所急
I appreciate how you're meeting the needs of the business.

312

谢谢
Thanks.

313
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,730
把这些水扔了  好吗
Get rid of the fucking water, yeah?

314
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,540
别太过分了
And don't take the piss.

315
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,860
去喝一杯吧
Go grab a pint.

316
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,870
工作结束后我可能会去找你
I might come find you when the work's done.

317
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,490
永远没个消停
No rest for the wicked.

318
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,240
有权势的女性
Women of power

319
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,620
似乎不喜欢给后来的女性机会
seem to like to withhold sunlight from women coming up.

320

{\an8}2020金融女性论坛  马隆默瑟公司妮可·克雷格

321
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,220
这不对  我们不能这样做
It's not cool. We can't be doing that.

322
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,580
成功
The success...

323
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,510
你有点受虐狂
You're a bit of a masochist.

324
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,000
-你说什么  -在会议上怼克莱门特
- Excuse me? - Negging Clement in the meeting.

325
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,730
我花了几个月才写出
I spent months writing something

326
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,140
那些销售在电话中重复的统一话术
for the fucking salesmen to parrot over the phone,

327
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,370
克莱门特都不愿意连屈尊
and Clement doesn't even have the humility to listen

328
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,940
听五分钟
for five fucking minutes.

329
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,370
对  但这是他的项目
Yeah, but his war stories though.

330
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,950
他就是个怪胎
He's a fucking dinosaur.

331
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,090
他花了两年才学会对我说"早上好"
It took two years for him to say "Good morning" to me.

332
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
他永远不会跟你说话的
He's never going to speak to you.

333
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,410
知道了  好吧  伙计  随便吧
Yeah, all right, mate. Whatever.

334
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,340
我的意思是  别指望
I'm just saying, don't think

335
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,010
那种家伙会在公司裁员时保护你
that a guy like that's gonna protect you on RIF.

336
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,640
克莱门特  他有卡斯帕的支持  那是个大客户
Clement, he's-- he's got Kaspar, that's one fucking account,

337
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,980
的确  这是个大客户
and yeah, it's-- it's big,

338
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,460
但确保你能活下来的唯一方法是大声说
but the only way to guarantee you survive is to say,

339
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,190
"我是创始人  我有笔新买卖"
"I am an originator. I won new business."

340
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,460
我记得当时我和阿德里安在一起
I remember I was with, um, Adrian.

341
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,780
我这脑子  那地方叫什么来着
Come on, what did this place used to be called?

342
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,450
拜托  那地方曾有个
It's, uh, come on, it used to have

343
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,770
很糟糕的两个字的名字
some really awful single syllable name

344
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,990
好像叫"特技"之类的
like "Stunt," or something like that.

345
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,980
看起来就像个建筑工地
Looked like a fucking building site.

346
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,990
所以  她有  她有"开机"按钮吗
So, um, does she have a-- does she have an "ON" button?

347
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,330
我一直在研究
Uh, I was looking into

348
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,610
-你所从事的买卖  -好吧  当务之急
- the business you did with... - Right. Uh, priorities.

349
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,770
我们可以点一些
Shall we get some wine

350
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,110
喝起来不像涂料稀释剂的酒吗
that doesn't taste like paint thinner?

351
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,890
-当然他妈的没问题  -是的
- Abso-fucking-lutely. - Yeah.

352
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,620
好吧  有些什么酒呢
Okay, what do we have?

353
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,780
你认识加斯吗
Do you, uh, do you know Gus?

354
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,320
是的  我们是室友  大学时就是了
Uh, yeah, yeah, I live with him. I lived with him at uni.

355
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,920
他上大学后我们就没怎么联系了
Oh, uh, we sort of lost touch while he was there.

356
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,810
我以前跟他一个学校的  跟他们都是
I went to school with him. With all those guys.

357
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,970
没想到你忍了这么久才提起伊顿
Surprised it took you that long to mention Eton.

358
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,600
"比他高两个年级  是个团长"  他如是说道
"Two years above. House Captain," He said.

359
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,610
我知道你们俩的很多事情
I know a lot about you two.

360
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,050
这样啊
Yeah.

361
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,780
回头见
Catch you later.

362
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,780
不停地说"一切都会好的"
Saying "Everything's gonna be okay" over and over

363
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,460
也阻止不了房子着火坍塌  不是吗
doesn't stop your house burning down around you, does it?

364
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,450
最终我们都得吃掉自己的宠物
Eventually we shall be eating our pets.

365
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,570
如果这是你的人生哲学  你可以推销它
Well, if that's your philosophy, you could trade it.

366
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,330
非常合理的两倍价
Extremely reasonable at twice the price.

367
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,870
我在反讽  这个价格非常昂贵
I'm being sarcastic. It is reassuringly expensive.

368
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,730
以4%收益率买入美国十年国债期权
Buy an option on the US ten year at four percent.

369
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,040
你还没出生前
Yields haven't been there

370
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,670
就没什么收益率了
since before you were born.

371
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,860
事实上是两千年初的时候
Actually, since the early aughts.

372
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,860
你那时还只有屁大点吧
Were you even sentient then?

373
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,180
不好意思  妮可  新人一般不负责给建议
Sorry, Nicole, graduates don't normally pitch.

374
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,920
谁管那么多  让她讲
Fuck that, let her talk.

375
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,590
如今总统败坏了
With the president bulldozing the reputation

376
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,250
美国在海外的名声
of the US overseas, you know,

377
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,250
我个人认为
for me, it follows that...

378
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,280
这个政府将完全抹杀财政部的信誉
the administration will totally kill the rep of treasuries.

379
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,550
而且和中国对着干也没好处
And pissing in China's mouth isn't gonna help.

380
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,770
没错  依我所见
Exactly. Personally?

381
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,790
我们迟早会经历一场大型做空
I just think we're due an enormous selloff.

382
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,610
我们在低调地和所有的
We're low key throwing ourselves in cold wars

383
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,430
贸易伙伴打冷战
with all of our trading partners.

384
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,640
中国是全球最大的美元持有者
China are the biggest global holder of US paper.

385
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,930
如果他们开始抛售美元  收益率很快会超过4%
If they start dumping, yields will soar past four percent.

386
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,270
如果你觉得房子要烧毁了
If you think the house is burning down,

387
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,420
你就这样从中获利
this is how you monetize it.

388
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,570
通常来说  在这个市场里做空会亏损
Bearish people lose money in this market.

389
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,470
没错  但是现在世界盛行尾部风险
Yeah, but the world's pregnant with tail risk.

390
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,680
没错  这是最后的赌局
Right, and this is a play for the end.

391
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,070
你们要再喝点什么吗
Who wants another drink, anyone?

392
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,020
我的物理治疗师最看不惯我宿醉
My PT hates it when I'm hungover.

393
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,790
我们恐怕必须带着爱意离开你了
We are gonna have to love you and leave you, I'm afraid.

394
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,790
-尽管很困难  -好吧  我就不起身了
- As hard as that is. - Right, well, I won't get up.

395
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,680
你可以滚去睡觉了
Fine for you to piss off to bed,

396
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,710
但我想听哈珀把话说完  行吗
but I'll let Harper finish her thoughts, yeah?

397
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,640
好吧
Right.

398
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,350
妮可
Nicole.

399
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,320
哈珀  记得付账
Harper. Pick up the bill.

400
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,920
米奇  你明早应该清醒一些
Mikey, you should be fresh in the morning.

401
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,050
没错  我会做节制一点的那个人
Yeah, I'll be the responsible one.

402
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,430
这是我的卡
Uh, here is my card.

403
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,640
谢谢
Thank you.

404
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,430
我可以发一封邮件给你
So, I can write up an email...

405
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,540
我不觉得你是个销售
I don't think you're a saleswoman.

406
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,280
我在夸奖你
That's a compliment.

407
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,400
销售卖的是肯定性
Salespeople sell... certainty.

408
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,870
很好
Ah, lovely.

409
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,090
生活多美好
What a life.

410
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,030
我叫了一辆优步
Got us an Uber.

411
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,720
这个时段溢价两倍
There's two times surge.

412
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,210
你花两倍的价钱回家
You pay twice as much to go home

413
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,460
却只有一半的快乐
and have half the fun.

414
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,470
擦一擦你的鼻子吧
Wipe your fucking nose.

415
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,850
两品脱就把你放倒了  对吧
It only takes two pints, doesn't it?

416
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,510
所有外展的家伙都抱团  我就知道
All the Outreach guys together, of course.

417
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,940
-这是因为...  -多样性雇员  我知道
- It's a scheme for... - Diversity hires, I know.

418
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,940
加斯觉得他看不上那些
Gus thinks he's above all that.

419
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,400
-我真讨厌你的友情  -那好  你出局了
- I resent your friendship. - Good. You're staying out.

420
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,960
好吧  我也不想被当成你们俩的朋友
Yeah, I'm not sure I can be seen fraternizing with you two.

421
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,690
我可一点没喝醉
I'm sober as a judge.

422
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,300
-进车里去  伙计  回家吧  -别推我
- Get in the car, man. Go home. - Don't push me.

423
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,200
尽量别吐在车里
Try not to throw up in there.

424
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,070
好的  老兄  去皮尔庞特
Yeah, mate, Pierpoint.

425
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,370
拜托带他回家  地址已经写进去了
Take him home, please. Destination's in.

426
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,810
明早我可以把期权提议发给你
I can write up that option idea for you in the morning.

427
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,140
如果你想的话
If you want.

428
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,540
好
Okay.

429
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,990
我能靠近点吗
Can I come a bit closer?

430
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,680
我太累了
I'm so tired.

431
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,910
他能把你送到任何地方
He can drop you anywhere.

432
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,550
萨瑟克
S-Southwark.

433
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,190
不是我家
...not my house.

434
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,250
这不是我家
It's not my house!

435
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,340
我家没有阳台
My house doesn't have balconies.

436
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,550
这就是你输入系统的地址  老兄
It's what you put in the system, mate.

437
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,720
不不不  没事  我  我很好
No, no, no. No, no, no. I'm-- I'm fine.

438
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,760
伙计  我要是留你一个人
Dude, if I leave you alone,

439
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,830
你该被自己的呕吐物呛死了
you're gonna choke on your own vomit.

440
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,680
-十分钟  就十分钟  -好吧
- Ten minutes, ten minutes. - Yeah, okay.

441
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,890
投资银行部怎么样  你今天走得挺早
How's IBD? You're out early.

442
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,210
我不知道  我觉得
Yeah, I don't know, I think...

443
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
我觉得他们针对我
I think they treat me differently.

444
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,630
比如说我上的是公立学校
Like I went to state school, and...

445
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,950
他们  他们跟我说话的方式都不一样
they-- they-- they even talk to me differently.

446
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,390
和我一桌的一个家伙  加斯
This guy on my desk, Gus,

447
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,850
我感觉他把工作当成了私事
I feel like he makes it his personal business...

448
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,820
试图让我觉得
trying to make me feel like

449
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,560
我没有价值什么的
I'm unworthy of it or something.

450
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,290
他听起来真是个混蛋
He sounds like a fucking asshole.

451
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,430
我和一个女人吃晚饭的时候
This weird thing happened at dinner

452
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,480
发生了一件怪事
with this woman.

453
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,450
一个客户
A client.

454
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,810
那不错啊  你已经开始和客户吃饭了
That's good. You're doing dinners with clients already.

455
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,510
是啊  我的部门经理  达莉娅
Yeah. Daria, my line manager,

456
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,270
突然间邀请了我
just invited me out of the blue.

457
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,260
晚餐进展得超级好
It went really well.

458
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,920
然后那个客户送我回家
And the-- the client, she gave me a ride home,

459
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,140
然后
and...

460
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,270
她好像
she sort of...

461
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,970
摸了我
touched me...

462
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,300
她是个女人  你知道吧
and she's a woman, you know?

463
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,150
但是  我也不知道  就是有点
But I don't know, it was still kind of...

464
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,010
奇怪
Weird.

465
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,030
我以为她喜欢我那个提议
I thought she bit on an idea,

466
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,680
但她好像暂时不打算和我签单子
but she won't want to deal with me now.

467
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,240
这不可能传到皮尔庞特  对吧
There's no way that it could get back to Pierpoint, right?

468
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,650
哈里
Hari?

469
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,810
有人知道今天是星期几吗
Does anybody know what day of the week it is?

470
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,370
瑞西  你会喜欢这个的
Rishi, you'll love this...

471
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,540
昨晚你们后来进展如何
So, how did the rest of the dinner go last night?

472
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,480
不错  挺好的
Yeah, it was fun.

473
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,020
你知道吗  我从没见过谁
You know, I've never actually seen someone

474
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,620
能成功保持妮可的注意
successfully hold Nicole's attention.

475
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,240
她出了名的难搞定
She's a notoriously hard nut to crack.

476
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,680
你后续跟进了吗
Have you followed up?

477
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,410
我不确定我现在就能给客户打电话
I'm not really sure I'm comfortable calling clients yet.

478
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,390
-我会发封邮箱的  -行
- I'll send an email. - Cool.

479
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,640
你休息了吗
You rested?

480
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,160
饥饿救星改时间了
HungerFix have changed the time.

481
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,570
他们明早九点来
They're in at nine tomorrow,

482
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,450
而且他们的首席运营官很自闭
and their COO is autistic.

483
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,020
不  我不是讽刺  她有自闭症
No, I'm not being snide, she has autism.

484
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,420
说实话  她也有点犯贱
And levelling with you, she's also a bit of a cunt.

485
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,990
这些都无关紧要
Those things are unrelated.

486
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,270
麻利点  加斯  模型做得怎么样了
Speed and clarity. Gus, how's the model?

487
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,250
我会在今晚前写好评论
I'll be done turning comments by tonight.

488
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,350
我们得在早上六点之前把书送去印刷
We need to get the book to the printers by 6:00 am.

489
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,040
别通宵  但告诉我你能完成任务
Don't stay up all night, but tell me that's doable.

490
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,690
我真喜欢你们俩
I like you two a lot.

491
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,550
你是罗伯特吧
Hi. Robert?

492
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,520
我注意到
Uh, I've noticed that, uh,

493
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,680
汇率和外汇部  以及其他团队

494
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,040
都提前开会了
start their meeting pre-open.

495
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,510
消费者投资组合服务的团队什么时候开会
When does the CPS one start?

496
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,870
每天时间都不一样
It-- it changes day to day.

497
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,100
埃里克不经常在  所以由克莱门特决定
Eric's not usually in it, so it's Clement's call.

498
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,330
那好  我希望以后改成七点开会
Well, urn, I'd like it to run from seven from now on,

499
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,530
明天开始
starting tomorrow.

500
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,470
你能帮我召集大家吗
Can you just round everyone up for me?

501
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,740
七点准
Seven on the dot.

502
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,020
七点开会  如果我有孩子的话
Seven? If I was a father,

503
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,260
我的早晨就全被毁了
that would seriously fuck with my morning.

504
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,590
有人想下班后去喝一杯吗
Anyone up for an after work bevvie?

505
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,610
周四晚提神醒脑一下

-去减压  -是的
- What, to take the edge off? - Yeah.

508

不了兄弟  还有换身西装吧
No, mate. And get a new suit.

509
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,750
你看上去就像黑客帝国里的尼奥
You look like fucking Neo.

510

我在忙别的事
I am doing anything else.

511

那我能拽你去吧
Surely I can drag you out?

512
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,930
拽我辫子吗
By my braids?

513
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,050
还是下次吧
Maybe next time.

514
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,070
我猜我们是这里
I guess we're the only people

515
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,520
唯二喜欢享乐的人
that like to have fun around here.

516
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,010
那是毒品吗
Is that packet?

517
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,760
K粉  咱们今天吃点素的
K. We're going vegan tonight.

518
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,070
我明天需要很早起来
See, I gotta be up really early.

519
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,780
干脆别睡了

Yeah, but you're not listening to me. It's just one page.

547
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,090
我把那一页的字体搞错了

熨烫自己的衬衫

我同意  我同意

如果我听着很沮丧  那是因为我真的很沮丧
If I'm sounding frustrated, it's 'cause I am frustrated!

602
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,350
听说他就那么死了  倒地而亡

对她来说  一切都顺风顺水
I mean, everything's aligned for her.

Can you price that option idea we talked about, half yard?

634
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,610
不可能  那比彩票的几率还小
No way. It's wingier than the fucking lottery.

635
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:10,160
再说你怎么能找到人买期权
And how the hell have you got someone to buy an option

in the South China Sea. When they do, this pays out.

639

- Need it in full, can you help? - No fucking way.

645
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:32,260
我这么估价肯定赔钱
I can't price it without losing money.

646

-那可是五亿啊  -客户不想听"不"
- That's half a billion. - The client will not hear "No,"

647
